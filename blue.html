							<h2> Website redesign for The Oxford Blue, the University of Oxford’s student newspaper publication. </h2>
							<h3> Overview </h3>
							<p> The current website for The Oxford Blue is difficult to navigate and not well organized. With all articles mostly on the homepage instead of being placed in categories, it is difficult to find even recent content without searching for it. Moreover, the website lacks a header and other information that is traditionally present in news publications. My role as Business Manager of the publication was using my design skills to redesign the site to appeal to students and potential sponsors.  </p>
							<p> Timeline: June – August 2020 </p>
							<p> Role: Website Designer </p>
							<p> Skills: UI/UX Design </p>

							<h3> Market Research </h3>

							<p> As news publications are constantly evolving and changing, I took a look at other outlets in a similar niche as The Oxford Blue to find examples of more refined user experiences, paying specific attention to the homepage. This served as a foundation for initial product exploration. </p>

							<h1> I firstly started with 2 world-renowned professional publications. </h1>

							<img src="images/nyt.png" width="400" height="300" alt="new york times">

							<img src="images/guardian.png" width="400" height="300" alt="the guardian">

							<p> The New York Times: NYT arranges homepage content with news on the left 2/3 of page and opinion articles on the right. Scrolling down reveals articles in the different sections, but there is also a navigation bar that leads to each section. The top of the site also includes important links such as to their podcast and daily briefing. </p>

							<p> The Guardian: The Guardian includes all top articles on the front page, irrespective of category, and scrolling down then better sorts articles out into their sections. They have merely 5 buttons as part of the navigation bar with an option to view more links. Section headings also have their own column along the left to differentiate easily. </p>

							<h1> I then moved onto a 2 top student publications. </h1>

							<img src="images/crimson.png" width="400" height="300" alt="the harvard crimson">

							<img src="images/varsity.png" width="400" height="300" alt="cambridge varsity">

							<p> The Harvard Crimson: The Crimson’s homepage looks similar to NYT with news and opinions taking the spotlight on the main page. They also include most read articles on the side and a link to donate at the very top of the page. Scrolling down reveals editor’s picks and articles by section. </p>

							<p> Varsity: Varsity’s homepage includes primarily news content followed by some top articles and then articles by section. Clicking on the navigation bar, however, leads to a heading on the main homepage itself as opposed to on its own page. A second click, on the heading, then takes the user to the page for the section. </p>

							<h3> Evaluating Current Design </h3>

							<p> In order to start visualising the new website, I wanted to get a better idea of the content that would be organized on The Oxford Blue’s website. I wanted to understand how content is distributed across sections and consistency so I could turn this into a feasible design layout. </p>

							<img src="images/website.png" width="400" height="300" alt="the oxford blue">

							<br>

							<h1> Key Takeways </h1>

							<p> 1. At the moment, not every section is used equally or has content produced on a consistent basis. This means that we need to be able to accommodate sections that publish on a more irregular basis or combine sections. </p>

							<p> 2. The homepage does not have a clear categorization of articles, but rather, is an endless feed of articles across sections. </p>

							<p> 3. The homepage does not clearly define what The Oxford Blue is nor does it link to any of the publication’s social media or other resources. </p>

							<h3> User Interviews </h3>

							<p> To understand better how to optimise the design, I interviewed 3 people on The Oxford Blue business team, 3 of the section editors, 3 small business owners in Oxford unaffiliated with the University, and 6 general University students for a total of 15 individuals. </p>

							<h1> Key Takeways </h1>

							<p> 1. The articles on the homepage would be more easily discoverable through blocks as opposed to through scrolling. </p>

							<p> 2. Both the Media team and Interviews team would like their content also showcased on the homepage, despite it not being in traditional article format. </p>

							<p> 3. The top articles for the week based on statistics should be easily accessible. </p>

							<h3> Goal </h3>

							<p> There are 2 goals of The Oxford Blue’s website redesign. </p>

							<p> 1. Provide value: Show content that is relevant, informative, current, educational, and helps the reader stay informed about everything happening around the University and greater community. </p>

							<p> 2. Attract sponsors: Give potential investors or partners a good initial impression of the publication to entice them to financially back the student newspaper </p>

							<h3> Style Guide </h3>

							<h1> Colors </h1>

							<p> The color palette for The Oxford Blue was already created and included primarily dark blue, light blue and pink. There was also the option to use both black and white as neutral colors. </p>

							<img src="images/colors.png" width="400" height="300" alt="colors">

							<br>

							<h1> Font Types </h1>

							<p> We picked Old Standard for the headers and larger text because it looks bold, historic and regal. It also matches the logo font well. The font for the main body text was Source Standard Pro because it is clean, friendly and easy to read. </p>

							<h3> Final Prototype </h3>

<br>

							<h3> Reflection </h3>

							<p> 1. Diverse feedback is important: Throughout the process, I asked a lot of current writers and editors of the newspaper what their feedback was for the design. However, I soon realized that other students with no connection to the publication were sometimes able to provide better feedback because they did not use the website on a daily basis. </p>

							<p> 2. Prioritizing the goals equally: During the design process, I primarily spoke with students and consumers of the content in order to provide value to anyone consuming content on the website. However, I soon realised that it was equally important for me to consider the needs of sponsors since this is what the business team of the newspaper were looking to attract. This meant I had to speak with owners of small businesses and those who worked at larger corporations as well as ensure that the homepage had all information that a potential sponsor might be looking for. </p>

							<h3> Graphic Design </h3>

							<p> While on the business team, I also created a variety of graphics for The Blue's social media accounts. I have layed out some of my favorites below. </p>
