            <p>Carbon emissions causing detrimental climate change effects are only increasing every year. Envaluate helps <b> track people's personalized carbon footprints </b> by linking to bank accounts and tracking spending.
            <br><br>
            As an intern, my job was working alongside a designer to  test and evaluate designs and provide feedback to <b> streamline user and business needs.</b>

            <h3 id='s2' class='section'>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <h2>With more data comes greater design challenge</h2>
            <p>In current spending tracking apps, users know what category they are spending in and how much money they spend but they don't know:</p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li><b>What the personal environemntal impact of their purchases is?</b>
                <li><b>How they can be more eco-friendly and reduce emissions? </b>
            </ul>
            <p>In this project, we are building a future in which users can know all those information.
            </p>

            <div class="project-img-div-med">
                    <img class="project-img-med" src="../lassets/DARPA/data-model.png" alt="Data Model">
            </div>
            <h4>Our project takes people's spending habits and models their carbon footprint</h4>
            <br>

            <p>Envaluate had already built an algorithm which translates people's purchases into kilograms of carbon dioxide emitted and categorizes their purchases by category. <br><br>
            Now that the ground work has been done by engineers, here are the design challenges: <p>
                <ul class="text-list">
                    <li><b>How should we display day-to-day transactions?</b></li>
                    <li><b>How can we help users understand their long-term spending trends?</b></li>
                    <li><b>How can users make tracking their impact a social activity?</b></li>
                </ul>

                <div class="space15px"></div><br>
                <h3 id='s3' class='section'>QUICK, ITERATIVE PROCESS</h3>
                    <p>Through an interactive design process, I was quickly moving between paper and digital <b>prototyping, testing </b>prototypes with users, and <b>co-creating</b> with and getting feedback from the lead designer and engineers. From each iteration, I learned something valuable. Some helped me make small usability improvements, some helped me make major changes in my design direction.
                </p>
                    <br>
                <h2>Initial iterations focused on data display</h2>

                    <p>My initial prototypes were focused on a flexible data display so that users can manage their emission data in different views: transaction-based, monthly, and attached to rewards. With research, <b>I experimented with all different ways of organizing the data, and how we could optimize each type.</b></p>

                    <div class="project-img-div-long">
                        <img class="project-img-long" src="../lassets/DARPA/initial-exploration.png" alt="Initial exploration">
                    </div>

            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h3 id='s4' class='section'>LEARNING FROM USERS</h3>
            <h2>Users only had a baseline understanding of climate issues</h2>
            <p>From initial testing, I learned that while users are <b>environmentally conscious,</b> they were <b> not aware about the complexities </b> of footprint tracking and did not know that different cateogories of purchases (eg. food, travel) contribute to a different amount of kilograms of carbon.
            </p>
            <div class="project-img-div-med">
                    <img class="project-img-med" src="../lassets/DARPA/quotes-filter.png" alt="Users don't know much about emissions">
            </div>
            <br>


            <h2>Users need external motivating factors to continue to use the app.</h2>
            <p>Users, while they did care about the climate, did not seem enthusiastic about returning to the app unless they were personally gaining something from it. Beyond just a basic data breakdown, they did not understand why they should use the app and wanted to see <b> more interactive features.</b> </p>

            <div class="project-img-div-med">
                    <img class="project-img-med" src="../lassets/DARPA/quotes-care.png" alt="Users need motivation">
            </div>

            <br>

            <p>This means:</p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li><b>Data breakdown needs to be simple. </b><br>Users will only understand the data if we can directly match each purchase with a numerical value and add these up to total their impact. More trends and data beyond this will complicate the experience and frustrate the user.</li>
                <li><b>People need to be able to see and get rewarded for their tracking</b><br> Users need some encouraging to keep coming back to the app beyond altruism.</li>
                <li><b>We need a way to make this a social experience< /b><br>Alongside rewards, motivation factors can come from friends and family.</li>
            </ul>
